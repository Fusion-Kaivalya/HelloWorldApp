## Key Stages of a CI/CD Pipeline

### 1. Source Code Management (SCM)
- **Description**: This is where the code is stored, typically in a Version Control System (VCS) like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
- **Automation**: Whenever code is pushed to the repository or a pull request is made, GitHub Actions triggers an automated pipeline. The `.github/workflows/ci-pipeline.yml` file defines the rules for running the pipeline.

### 2. Build
- **Description**: The build stage compiles the application code and ensures that the application can be built without errors.
- **Automation**: In this GitHub Actions workflow, the `dotnet build` command is executed to automatically build the project using .NET 8.

### 3. Testing
- **Description**: The testing stage runs automated unit tests to verify that the code behaves as expected.
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions runs the `dotnet test` command as part of the pipeline, ensuring that tests are executed every time code is pushed or merged.

### 4. Deployment (optional for the current setup)
- **Description**: After successful builds and tests, the code is deployed to staging or production environments.
- **Automation**: Deployment can be automated using tools like GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, AWS CodePipeline, or CircleCI to push the application to cloud platforms like Azure, AWS, or Heroku.

### 5. Monitoring & Alerts (optional)
- **Description**: After deployment, monitoring ensures the application runs smoothly, and alerts notify the team if there are issues.
- **Automation**: Tools like Prometheus, Datadog, or Azure Monitor can be integrated into the pipeline to automate monitoring and alerting.

## Example Explanation of Automation with GitHub Actions

- **Source Control Integration**: GitHub Actions is automatically triggered whenever there is a push or pull request. This ensures that the pipeline runs as soon as changes are made to the codebase.
  
- **Build Automation**: The build stage is automated using the `dotnet build` command, defined in the `ci-pipeline.yml` file, which compiles the code for every push or pull request.

- **Test Automation**: Unit tests are automatically executed with the `dotnet test` command in the GitHub Actions workflow. This ensures that the code is tested in a consistent environment.
